    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Bulgogi (Korean: 불고기; American English /bʊlˈɡoʊɡiː/ buul-GOH-ghee; from
      Korean bul-gogi [pul.ɡo.ɡi]), literally "fire meat") is a gui
      (Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of
      meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a
      very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from
      upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.
